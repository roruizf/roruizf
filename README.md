👋 Hi, I’m Roberto Ruiz – a mechanical engineer with 10+ years of experience in building energy efficiency and performance simulation.

🔧 I specialize in supporting BREEAM and LEED certifications using tools like EnergyPlus, OpenStudio, and TRNSYS.

💻 On the coding side, I explore data analysis, automation, and simulation workflows with Python, SQL, and Power BI.

🧪 Here you’ll find personal projects and utilities related to:
- Energy modeling workflows
- Data analysis from simulation outputs
- Visualization tools for HVAC and building systems

🌍 Passionate about sustainability, I use my GitHub space to test ideas that combine engineering, energy, and data.
